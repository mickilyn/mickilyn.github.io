 Traveling Lighthouse

This will be a website for the purpose of Qody and my, Micki Lyn's progress as we travel the United States sharing God's word and healing. 

Its primary focus will be on showcasing our message and videos from our time set up at a table. 

There will need to be an area embedding our videos, as well as our mission statement and a bit about us. If we redirect to the Youtube channel, then we may be able to get away with one long-form page.
